# webrtc-learning-exercise

To learn more about WebRTC API and the handshake step necessary, I built a chat app. WebRTC requires a side channel to establish the connection via. The side channel exchanges protocol and feature support barters, as well as available connection IP and port pairs. For this project, the user's clipboard acts as the side channel. This is tedious to use, but shed light on the purpose of this initial exchange.
